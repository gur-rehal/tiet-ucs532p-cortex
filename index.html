<h1>Automated Road & Concrete Crack Detection and Severity Analysis</h1>

<h2>1. Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Road and concrete infrastructures form the backbone of urban mobility and economic activity. However, due to continuous exposure to environmental stress, cyclic loading, material fatigue, and aging, these surfaces gradually develop cracks. Studies indicate that nearly 70–80% of road failures originate as minor surface cracks. If detected at an early stage, the cost of repair can be reduced by 4–6 times compared to delayed reconstruction. Therefore, early identification and quantitative assessment of cracks are critical for preventive maintenance and infrastructure sustainability.</p>

<p>Currently, inspection practices are predominantly manual. Engineers visually examine surfaces and document observations based on subjective judgment. This approach is time-consuming, labor-intensive, inconsistent across inspectors, and difficult to scale across large networks spanning hundreds of kilometers. While some automated systems exist, many focus only on binary classification—detecting whether a crack exists or not—without providing measurable severity analysis required for decision-making.</p>

<p>This project proposes a Computer Vision (CV) based system that processes RGB surface imagery and converts it into measurable structural indicators. The system not only detects and segments cracks but also computes quantitative metrics such as crack width, length, density, and connectivity. These metrics are aggregated into a Crack Severity Index categorized into low, medium, and high risk levels. The final output supports data-driven maintenance prioritization for municipal authorities, civil engineers, smart city platforms, and inspection agencies.</p>

<h2>2. Objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Primary Objective:</strong><br>
To design and implement a scalable computer vision pipeline capable of automatically detecting, segmenting, and quantifying cracks in road and concrete surfaces using RGB imagery.</p>

<p><strong>Specific Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To collect and preprocess diverse surface images with lighting normalization and noise reduction.</li>
<li>To extract edge-based and texture-based features to identify potential crack regions.</li>
<li>To perform crack segmentation using classical computer vision techniques.</li>
<li>To compute structural metrics including crack width, length, density, and connectivity.</li>
<li>To develop a Crack Severity Index for maintenance prioritization.</li>
<li>To evaluate system performance using segmentation accuracy and robustness metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Methodology</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Image Acquisition and Preprocessing:</strong> RGB images are captured from fixed roadside cameras, vehicle-mounted systems, or drone platforms. Preprocessing includes resizing, grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, contrast enhancement, and Gaussian filtering.</li>

<li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Edge detection algorithms such as Canny and Sobel operators highlight structural discontinuities. Texture descriptors help differentiate cracks from shadows or stains.</li>

<li><strong>Feature Fusion:</strong> Multiple extracted features are combined to enhance reliability and reduce false positives.</li>

<li><strong>Crack Segmentation:</strong> Morphological operations and thresholding isolate crack regions and generate binary masks.</li>

<li><strong>Orientation Consistency Filtering:</strong> Removes random noise while preserving structurally meaningful crack patterns.</li>

<li><strong>Severity Metric Computation:</strong> Crack width, length, density, and connectivity are computed and aggregated into a Crack Severity Index.</li>
</ol>
